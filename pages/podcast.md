##FAQ

### What the hell is a plasma and a fusion? 

[Plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)) is the fourth state of matter, with its main property being highly [conductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity). 

Typically, a plasma is very hot, and one example of plasma is stars. 
The protons of the plasma in our Sun undergo a process of [fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion), where two Hydrogen atoms (protons) collide with such energy that they overcome the electrostatic barrier and turn into one Helium atom. 
Since one helium atom weighs less than two hydrogen atoms (suprisingly enough), this process releases energy, which was shown by Einstein by his famous E=mc^2 equation, i.e., the mass is liberated in the form of energy.

It is possible to artificially recreate this process on Earth, and is a internationally sought after goal across the world. 



### Why a podcast on plasma and fusion? 

To share to the world the wonders of plasma (and other things that interest us). 

### Why are you the hosts? 

**Adam**: Teaching is a my favourite way to learn, and my job is to learn about plasma.

### Who is this podcast for? 

All english speaking people of the world that have an interest in learning something new. It might be biased to those in science, but Adam is learning to be more inclusive in his choice of language. 

### Do we need yet another podcast with cis-white male?

Valid point, probably not. 


## Resources 

After we finish a series, we will probably write a blog post about it which will have a list of resources and material we used for the series.
